Overview
========

This project is meant to replace killedbypolice.net, a project that
tracked individuals killed by police up until mid-2018, when the curator
announced he could no longer dedicate time to the project and stopped updating
the website with information.

This product was commissioned by DonutOperator, a YouTube police personality
and former SWAT officer who discusses law enforcement and issues related to
law enforcement in America today, providing the perspective of an officer to
the discussion.

Features
========

This application provides an easy to read, searchable list of results for 
police killings and bodycams to the average user, as well as a news blog
for DonutOperator to interact with his followers.

For DonutOperator, it provides a set of administrative tools for adding, editing
and deleting records from the results.
